++ The Origins of the Cookie Party App

This app was made for Aymee & Ross's Annual Cookie Party.  

Every year they spent a lot of time counting votes during the party. Now that they have a baby it just makes it even harder for them to take time away to count votes.  

I decided to create this app so the votes are tallied automatically as the votes are placed.  

My friend Hannah Howard was instrumental in making this happen. She helped me get it up and running and guided me through the process. I styled it so it matches the invite to the cookie party this year.  

I plan to make a lot of improvements to this app so I can learn even more.
